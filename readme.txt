finally you can run python dogfacenetï¼Œmodel will saved in data/model, if the progress is interupt,it will not restart from begining , it will reload the saved model and continue. but for now it will not showed in the prgress (maybe add a text file to save the current epoch will make this part better, to do this ,you will need change already_step in the define area)
